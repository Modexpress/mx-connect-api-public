                                        A number that specifies the sequence of the size codes (relevant for type SIZE/SIZE2). The number is used to specify the display order on the packing slip.\r\n\r\nIn case of type SIZE/SIZE2 the sortingnumber of the size codes (in attribute value) is particularly relevant if the size codes cannot be logically sorted. For example in case of size codes like XS, X, M, XXL.\r\nIf there are several size groups in use, the sortingnumber must be unique for the size codes within the size group. However the size group is not known in the Modexpress SKU registration, so for the packing slip the SKU style is used to determine the size codes that have to be used on the packing slip. The sortingnumber is used to determine the order of the size codes on the packing slip.

                  description: |
                    An order to receive goods (stock). A receipt consists of two parts that can be registered simultaneously or separately:
                    - Purchase/return order (PO/RMA); the order from the ordering party to receive goods; these are goods that the ordering party has purchased from suppliers or is taking back as returns from buyers/recipients.
                    - Shipment; a shipment to be supplied by a supplier or buyer/recipient for a purchase/return order.
                    - By default it is assumed that the purchase/return order and the shipment are the same. This means that it is sufficient to specify the purchase/return order without specifying shipments. The submitted purchase/return order is automatically regarded as the shipment to be received (in terms of the contents, the shipment is the same as the purchase/return order).

                        The identification that the ordering party uses for the order. Based on this identification, Modexpress checks whether the registered order already exists for the ordering party.
                        Cancelled orders or executed orders on which nothing has been received, are not taken into consideration. If an order already exists, the registration is rejected.\r\n\r\nIf purchase/return orders and shipments are registered separately, this identification is used to link the shipment to a purchase/return order that was reported earlier.

                        The registration of a shipment to be supplied for a purchase/return order by a supplier or buyer/recipient. There are four possibilities:
                        1. the shipment(s) for a purchase order from an ordering party is/are provided separately by the supplier (not yet implemented)
                        2. the shipment(s) for a purchase order is/are provided by the ordering party itself together with the purchase order
                        3. the shipment(s) for a purchase order is/are provided by the ordering party itself separately from the purchase order (not yet implemented)
                        4. no shipment(s) are provided for a purchase order, each purchase order automatically results in a corresponding shipment that is the same as the purchase order in terms of its contents.

                        Pay attention; a combination of 2 and 4 is not possible. So, if ShipmentLines are provided for the PurchaseOrderLines, it is necessary that every PurchaseOrderLine has a ShipmentLine and the Quantity in both lines has to be the same.
                        When a shipment is provided separately, a reference to the purchase/return order is required; this is done using the 'id' of the order. Moreover, the purchase/return order must then be registered/provided before the shipment is registered/provided."

On the basis of this identification Modexpress checks whether this order already exists for the ordering party (in Modexpress ERP/WMS). Cancelled orders are not taken into consideration. If an order already exists there are two options: - the new order is rejected without question, or - an attempt is made to cancel the existing order, if this is possible the new order is processed, otherwise the new order is rejected. The option to use must be configured.

                              Designation of the type of stock that must be delivered. Using the stock type, it is possible to differentiate according to different types of stock that must be maintained separately for an article (both in the operation and administratively).
                              The standard stock types are (other types are possible):
                              - RGL: regular or A-choice stock
                              - RGLRJC - regular reject or B-choice stock.
                              If no StockType is indicated the delivery is assumed to be regular stock (RGL).

                                              Designation of the type of stock. Using the stock type, it is possible to differentiate according to different types of stock that must be maintained separately for an article (both in the operation and administratively).
                                              The standard stock types are (other types are possible):
                                              - RGL - regular stock (A-choice stock)
                                              - KWL - regular stock, blocked for quality control (not available for SHP)
                                              - BLK -  regular stock, blocked for other reason (not available for shipping)
                                              - RGLRJC - regular reject stock (B-choice stock)
                                              - KWLRJC - regular reject stock, blocked for quality control (not available for shipping)
                                              - BLKRJC - regular reject stock, blocked for other reason (not available for shipping)
                                              - INN - regular stock (A-choice stock), received in inbound area
                                              - INNRJC - regular reject stock (B-choice stock), received in inbound area
                                              - INR - regular stock (A-choice stock), received in return inbound area
                                              - INRRJC - regular reject stock (B-choice stock), received in return inbound area
                                              If the received stock in the RCP-exec interface is used to add the stock in your ERP, the stock movements regarding the INN(RJC) and INR(RJC) stocktypes will not be sent. 
                                              However, it is still possible there will be stock corrections regarding the INN(RJC) and INR(RJC) stocktypes. Depending on the handling of the stock in your ERP, these corrections should probably be made to the RGL(RJC) stock.

                              Designation of the type of stock. Using the stock type, it is possible to differentiate according to different types of stock that must be maintained separately for an article (both in the operation and administratively).
                              The standard stock types are (other types are possible):
                              - RGL - regular stock (A-choice stock)
                              - KWL - regular stock, blocked for quality control (not available for SHP)
                              - BLK -  regular stock, blocked for other reason (not available for shipping)
                              - RGLRJC - regular reject stock (B-choice stock)
                              - KWLRJC - regular reject stock, blocked for quality control (not available for shipping)
                              - BLKRJC - regular reject stock, blocked for other reason (not available for shipping)
                              - INN - regular stock (A-choice stock), received in inbound area
                              - INNRJC - regular reject stock (B-choice stock), received in inbound area
                              - INR - regular stock (A-choice stock), received in return inbound area
                              - INRRJC - regular reject stock (B-choice stock), received in return inbound area
                              If the received stock in the RCP-exec interface is used to add the stock in your ERP, the stock movements regarding the INN(RJC) and INR(RJC) stocktypes will not be sent. 
                              However, it is still possible there will be stock corrections regarding the INN(RJC) and INR(RJC) stocktypes. Depending on the handling of the stock in your ERP, these corrections should probably be made to the RGL(RJC) stock.
