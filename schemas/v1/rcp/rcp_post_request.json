So, if ShipmentLines are provided for the PurchaseOrderLines, it is necessary that every PurchaseOrderLine has a ShipmentLine and the Quantity in both lines has to be the same.\nWhen a shipment is provided separately, a reference to the purchase/return order is required; this is done using the 'id' of the order. Moreover, the purchase/return order must then be registered/provided before the shipment is registered/provided.\"\n",
