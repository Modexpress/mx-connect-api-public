                                        A number that specifies the sequence of the size codes (relevant for type SIZE/SIZE2). The number is used to specify the display order on the packing slip.\r\n\r\nIn case of type SIZE/SIZE2 the sortingnumber of the size codes (in attribute value) is particularly relevant if the size codes cannot be logically sorted. For example in case of size codes like XS, X, M, XXL.\r\nIf there are several size groups in use, the sortingnumber must be unique for the size codes within the size group. However the size group is not known in the Modexpress SKU registration, so for the packing slip the SKU style is used to determine the size codes that have to be used on the packing slip. The sortingnumber is used to determine the order of the size codes on the packing slip.

                  description: |
                    An order to receive goods (stock). A receipt consists of two parts that can be registered simultaneously or separately:
                    - Purchase/return order (PO/RMA); the order from the ordering party to receive goods; these are goods that the ordering party has purchased from suppliers or is taking back as returns from buyers/recipients.
                    - Shipment; a shipment to be supplied by a supplier or buyer/recipient for a purchase/return order.
                    - By default it is assumed that the purchase/return order and the shipment are the same. This means that it is sufficient to specify the purchase/return order without specifying shipments. The submitted purchase/return order is automatically regarded as the shipment to be received (in terms of the contents, the shipment is the same as the purchase/return order).

                        Cancelled orders or executed orders on which nothing has been received, are not taken into consideration. If an order already exists, the registration is rejected.\r\n\r\nIf purchase/return orders and shipments are registered separately, this identification is used to link the shipment to a purchase/return order that was reported earlier.

                                       - Type 'EUR.1' certificate
                                      A EUR.1 certificate is only used for goods of preferential origin. 
                                      To get a discount or exemption on import duties when imported from a contracting country, ask your supplier to enclose a EUR.1 certificate with the shipment.

                                       - Type 'EUR-MED'
                                      A EUR-MED certificate is a variant of the EUR.1 and is only valid if you trade with countries where the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Agreement applies. 
                                      This agreement makes it possible for raw materials and products of preferential origin from these countries to count towards the determination of origin (so-called cumulation). 
                                      You use a EUR-MED instead of a EUR.1 and offers more options for re-export to another partner country within this country group.

                                       - Type 'ATR'
                                      An ATR certificate is a customs document that you can use for trade between countries from the EU and Turkey. 
                                      The EU forms a customs union with Turkey, so you can import goods from Turkey without import duties. 
                                      Origin means that the product was produced in Turkey or was previously imported into Turkey from another country. 
                                      The Turkish origin is recorded in the ATR certificate. Your Turkish supplier requests the certificate from Turkish customs.

                                       - Type 'CVO'
                                      A Certificate of Origin (CVO) is proof of the origin of a product. 
                                      A CVO contains the description and origin of your products, and the name and address details of the seller and buyer. 
                                      In the Netherlands, the Chamber of Commerce confirms the origin on CVOs with a digital stamp and signature.

                                      Up to 2 certificates can apply to the same ShipmentLine, the following combinations are possible:
                                      - EUR.1 + CVO
                                      - ATR + CVO
                                      - EUR-MED + CVO

                        The registration of a shipment to be supplied for a purchase/return order by a supplier or buyer/recipient. There are four possibilities:
                        1. the shipment(s) for a purchase order from an ordering party is/are provided separately by the supplier (not yet implemented)
                        2. the shipment(s) for a purchase order is/are provided by the ordering party itself together with the purchase order
                        3. the shipment(s) for a purchase order is/are provided by the ordering party itself separately from the purchase order (not yet implemented)
                        4. no shipment(s) are provided for a purchase order, each purchase order automatically results in a corresponding shipment that is the same as the purchase order in terms of its contents.

                        Pay attention; a combination of 2 and 4 is not possible. So, if ShipmentLines are provided for the PurchaseOrderLines, it is necessary that every PurchaseOrderLine has a ShipmentLine and the Quantity in both lines has to be the same.
                        When a shipment is provided separately, a reference to the purchase/return order is required; this is done using the 'id' of the order. Moreover, the purchase/return order must then be registered/provided before the shipment is registered/provided."

                                             - Type 'REX', Registered Exporter, 
                                            With the status of REX, an exporter can put a so-called 'certificate of origin' on its invoices. This gives importers a preference when importing products into the European Union. A certificate of origin is valid for 12 months.
                                            Companies can see in a database of the European Union whether an exporter is REX. After registration as a REX, the authorities no longer issue a Form A certificate.


                                             - Type 'TE', Allowed Exporter
                                            For companies that regularly export with a EUR.1 or EUR-MED document, who have a clear delivery program and have sufficient knowledge of import and export, there is the 'Toegelaten Exporteur' (TE) scheme. After an extensive application procedure, these exporters are granted an Authorized Exporter Self-Issuing Preferential Proofs of Origin license. From that moment on, they can use an invoice declaration instead of a EUR.1 or EUR-MED certificate. The license number is stated in this invoice declaration. The exporter can provide his sales invoice with this statement without the intervention of the Chamber of Commerce and present it to Dutch Customs in the country of destination. The function and responsibilities remain the same for all parties involved as for the use of EUR.1 or EUR-MED documents.

                                             - Type 'PREF-ORG', Preferential OriginStatement for other than REX or TE Exporter. 
                                            In case reduction of import duties is applicable. 
                                            For 'PREF-ORG' LicenceNumber is optional

                                            Only one InvoiceStatement (if applicable) type is allowed per Shipment

If an order already exists there are two options: - the new order is rejected without question, or - an attempt is made to cancel the existing order, if this is possible the new order is processed, otherwise the new order is rejected. The option to use must be configured.

                                              Designation of the type of stock. Using the stock type, it is possible to differentiate according to different types of stock that must be maintained separately for an article (both in the operation and administratively).
                                              The standard stock types are (other types are possible):
                                              - RGL - regular stock (A-choice stock)
                                              - KWL - regular stock, blocked for quality control (not available for SHP)
                                              - BLK -  regular stock, blocked for other reason (not available for shipping)
                                              - RGLRJC - regular reject stock (B-choice stock)
                                              - KWLRJC - regular reject stock, blocked for quality control (not available for shipping)
                                              - BLKRJC - regular reject stock, blocked for other reason (not available for shipping)
                                              - INN - regular stock (A-choice stock), received in inbound area
                                              - INNRJC - regular reject stock (B-choice stock), received in inbound area
                                              - INR - regular stock (A-choice stock), received in return inbound area
                                              - INRRJC - regular reject stock (B-choice stock), received in return inbound area
                                              If the received stock in the RCP-exec interface is used to add the stock in your ERP, the stock movements regarding the INN(RJC) and INR(RJC) stocktypes will not be sent. 
                                              However, it is still possible there will be stock corrections regarding the INN(RJC) and INR(RJC) stocktypes. Depending on the handling of the stock in your ERP, these corrections should probably be made to the RGL(RJC) stock.

                              Designation of the type of stock. Using the stock type, it is possible to differentiate according to different types of stock that must be maintained separately for an article (both in the operation and administratively).
                              The standard stock types are (other types are possible):
                              - RGL - regular stock (A-choice stock)
                              - KWL - regular stock, blocked for quality control (not available for SHP)
                              - BLK -  regular stock, blocked for other reason (not available for shipping)
                              - RGLRJC - regular reject stock (B-choice stock)
                              - KWLRJC - regular reject stock, blocked for quality control (not available for shipping)
                              - BLKRJC - regular reject stock, blocked for other reason (not available for shipping)
                              - INN - regular stock (A-choice stock), received in inbound area
                              - INNRJC - regular reject stock (B-choice stock), received in inbound area
                              - INR - regular stock (A-choice stock), received in return inbound area
                              - INRRJC - regular reject stock (B-choice stock), received in return inbound area
                              If the received stock in the RCP-exec interface is used to add the stock in your ERP, the stock movements regarding the INN(RJC) and INR(RJC) stocktypes will not be sent. 
                              However, it is still possible there will be stock corrections regarding the INN(RJC) and INR(RJC) stocktypes. Depending on the handling of the stock in your ERP, these corrections should probably be made to the RGL(RJC) stock.

                                  If Currency <> EUR then Exchange rate (against EUR) at date of export must be registered.
                                  This because there can be months between the original export and the return of the final product. 
                                  The calculations are always made based on currency=EUR.

                                  Example: Currency used is DKK, then the exchange rate EUR/DKK should be used.  
                                  EUR/DKK = 7.44 at the time of export, so that is the value that should be populated in this field.

                                  DKK 7,44 = EUR 1
