# Modexpress MX Connect Receipt Orders v2 Webhook configuration

**Webhook "Receipt Orders"**

We are introducing a **new webhook variant** alongside the current version. The new webhook uses the `rcp.phase.update` action instead of `rcp.status.update`. We **strongly advise using the new version**, as the old webhook may not provide sufficient detail about the receipt status. For example, an order may be reported as closed while customs activities are still pending. In such cases, stock might not yet be available for ordering, which could result in rejected orders due to unavailable inventory.

**Webhook Payload**

The Modexpress Receipt Orders webhook allows you to stay informed about order status changes. When the `rcp.phase.update` event is triggered and you have subscribed to this event, weâ€™ll send a `HTTP POST` payload to your configured webhook URL. The webhook payload for receipt orders contains the following properties:

| **Key**                       | **Type** | **Description**                                                                      |

| payload.Id                    | string   | The id of the order for which the status was updated                                 |
